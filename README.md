# Uncommon Ada Error: Attribute Misuse

This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in Ada programming related to the misuse of attributes.  Ada's powerful attribute system can be a source of confusion if not used correctly. This specific example focuses on the potential pitfalls of using attributes with types and representation clauses.  The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides the corrected version.

## Problem Description

The primary issue is likely to be related to either the improper use of an attribute to access type-specific information or an incorrect application of representation attributes.
